# AWS-Flights-Batch-Pipeline
The AWS-Flights-Batch-Pipeline automates the fetching, transforming, and processing of flight data from multiple airports using AWS Lambda, S3, Glue, Step Functions, EventBridge, SNS, and Redshift. It collects raw JSON data, cleans and concatenates it with Glue, converts to Parquet, and stores it in Redshift for efficient querying and analysis.
